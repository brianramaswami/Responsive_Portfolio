                I just graduated from Gonzaga University (May 2019) with a BS in Computer Science. 
                I am looking for a full-time job as an Entry Level Software Developer or as an Intern 
                where I can grow as a programmer within your company. My attached resume provides evidence of relevant coursework and languages needed to excel 
                at this position.

            <p>
                 My coursework has given me a rich mixture of both the theoretical and practical 
                sides of my field. The classes "Design and Analysis of Algorithms", "Object Oriented Programming", 
                and "Data Structures" provided fundamentals of programming at a high level. 
            </p>

            <p>
                  I also took upper division classes in "Cryptography", "Computer Graphics", and "Computational Modeling". These classes provided 
                  practical aspects of coding such as building animations in C++, designing real world scientific models in 
                  Java, and encrypting messages over the internet in Python.

            <h5>Full Stack Web Developer - 2017</h5>
            <p>
                I attended a 24-week program on becoming a Full Stack Web Developer. During that time I learned technologies such as HTML5, JavaScript, JQuery, React.js. I learned design tecniques such as CSS, Bootstrap, and Sass. I mastered RESTful API's and AJAX calls. 
            </p> 

            <p> 
                I also learned server side technologies such as Node.js and Express.js. I worked with relational databases like MySQL and non-relational databases such as MongoDB. By the end of the class I mastered the Front and Back end of Web Development.

            <h3>My Experience</h3>
            <p>
                I have experience coding in an agile enviornment . While working with the Gonzaga University English Learning Center, my team of 5 other developers and I, implemented a dynamically growing online classroom.

                Teachers could post assignments on a web app. Students could access those assignments and 
                submit their responses. Teachers could then give feedback and assign grades to each student. Some of the technologies I used to create this app were JavaScript, JQuery, CSS, HTML, 
                Ajax, SQL, Microsoft Azure, and Node.JS.
